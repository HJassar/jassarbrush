Developed a responsive and dynamic gallery for my cousin's artwork.

* The media is controlled by the admin in **Airtable**, took advantage of Next.js's API to avoid coding a full backend platform. The approach was based on the short deadline (2 days) and the power that Airtable provides.
* The website is responsive (mobile-friendly)

Potential future implementations
* Dynamic Pages
* Theming options
* Gallery filters (already implemented in the links)
* Shop
